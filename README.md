## Introduction

Welcome to **Dice Dominion**, a strategy-based multiplayer board game that challenges players to think ahead, adapt, and compete for dominance. This project was developed as part of our university coursework called **Bachelor Project**, with the goal of designing *"awesone software as a team to achieve greater results than you would be able to on your own"*.   

The idea for **Dice Dominion** came from dice that one of us had at home, a notebook, two stabilo pens, and our desire to create a game that we could enjoy together, inspired by classic tile-placement mechanics and bored-student classroom games with an added element of chance through dice rolls.

### What does this software do?  
- Provides an interactive, web-based board game where players take turns rolling dice and placing blocks.  
- Supports multiplayer functionality, allowing 2 players to compete in real-time.  
- Includes a customizable grid (from 10 up to 20 cells) and player colors for a personalized experience.  

We have designed **Dice Dominion** with simplicity in mind, making it easy to learn while still offering depth for strategic play. Whether you're a casual player or a board game enthusiast, we hope this game brings whoever is playing it as much enjoyment as it brought us while developing it.

## Quick Start

### Starting the Game

Once you open [the game in your browser](https://berkesevenler.github.io/HostingTest-DiceDominion/), you'll be greeted with the game board. You can either:

1. **Create a Lobby:** Choose the grid size, select a color for your blocks, and start a lobby. You will then wait for another player to join, either through an invitation link or by finding your lobby in the public list.
2. **Join a Lobby:** Select your color and join an existing lobby by either clicking an invitation link or selecting a public lobby.

### How to Play

- Start from a designated corner:
  - **Player 1:** Upper left corner.
  - **Player 2:** Lower right corner.
- Roll the dice to determine your block size.
- Press **R** to rotate blocks before placing them.
- Your next block must be connected to one of your previous blocks.
- You can skip your turn up to **three times** if you have no valid moves.
- The game ends when no moves are left.
- The first player to **occupy at least half of the grid** is declared the winner!

### After the Game

- If someone wins, the game automatically ends, and all players are redirected to the main menu.
- If you want to leave mid-game, you can use the **Exit** button, which will prompt a warning message before confirming.
- Once the game ends or you exit, you return to the menu, and the cycle repeats.



## Usage

- **Rolling Dice:** Click the "Roll Dice" button to determine the size of your block.
- **Placing Blocks:** Click on the board to place your block. It must be connected to your existing territory.
- **Rotating Blocks:** Press **R** before placing a block to rotate it.

- **Winning:** The game ends when no moves are left. The player with the most blocks wins!

Finally, we would like to acknowledge the original inspiration behind this game. It was initially conceived as a fun way for one of our team members and their partner to spend more time playing together on weekends. What started as a simple idea, just a small, lighthearted game, was brought up in our first team meeting as a potential project for this course. Since then, it has evolved from a physical game to a virtual one! And we are excited to share it with others.

We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed developing it!
